[Barristan "Bear" Tardiff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/114005666)

I'm a deserted solider from the giff (hard g) armies. I dream to travel space and find a safe new home for me and my giff (hard g) brothers to live in peace, accepted, and away from those giff (soft g) rebels.


On an Adventure in [[Wild Space]]. I'm on this random plane after a long hard mission, I'm just trying to figure out my next job.
