Tavern near the docks at [[The Rock of Bral]]. [[Captain Elaina Sartel]] told us to check that out as the first stop after we departed from [[The Moondancer]]

[[Astrid]] got too drank some bad booze and ended up passing out in the hallway, [[Solara Sunfire]] ran into her with a man standing over her trying to steal her gold. Solara swung at him with her sword and did some damage. She pushed him down the stairs and ended up getting [[Bex Berghold]] in trouble with [[Large Luigi]] who told us not to start fights in the bar. in her defense [[Bex Berghold]] tried to wake up the thief in front of [[Large Luigi]]. we fought off the theif and went to bed.

## The next day
The giff (hard g) in the kitchen cooked me up some eggs, astrid had a cosmic hamster and bex found a table and "hunkered down". We see a couple of #Giff and a couple of #Gith and a few #Hadozee and even a #Plasmoid. We see some really nice weapons and armor on one of the #Gith. She asks him about a merchant/blacksmith. He recommended the market north of here.

We head into the [[Lesser Market of Bral|Lesser Market]]
