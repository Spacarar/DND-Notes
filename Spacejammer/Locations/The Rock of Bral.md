planet [[Captain Elaina Sartel]] wants to drop us off on the rock of bral. This is some rock in [[Wild Space]]

#Location

[[Captain Elaina Sartel]] said to check out [[The Happy Beholder]] 

We went on a history tour from [[Gepar]] (Hadozee child)
originally founded by a pirate captain Bral, Prince Andru is the current ruler after his older brother Cailer died recently. [[Prince Andru|Andru]] executed the people believed responsible for his brother's death. The Hadozee child who was giving us a tour said he didn't believe Andru had gotten them.

The underside of the rock is reserved for military

There is a Gifftown divided in two. the left (west/lower) city is Giff (Hard G) and the right (east/upper) part is Giff (Soft G). 

in #Episode7 I learned that [[Prince Andru]] had a brother who died 6 years ago [[Kozar]] who believes there was some foul play involved. Andru is just one player in this world who has a host of players loyal to him, but he has to watch out for some guilds around the rock of bral. This rock used to be a pirate safe-haven, but [[Kozar]] and [[Prince Andru]]. [[Large Luigi]] told us about [[The Underbarons]] who had 4 different leaders. I've asked luigi about what he thinks, but he's not sure about a rightful leader, but he might be able to tell us a bit more about how to possibly help [[Gepar]]. [[Commodore Krux]] is a #Giff #SoftGiff
