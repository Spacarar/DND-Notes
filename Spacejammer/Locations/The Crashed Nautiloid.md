Mindflayer ship infested with Cargo deck is covered in blood with a dead #neogi. I noticed there were circular bite marks bitten. I couldn't tell where they come from, but I could tell the #neogi died recently.
when we went to the prison deck, dm said we saw creatures with white fur dead, and heard shuffling. We couldn't figure out what it was.

This ship was found near [[The Rock of Bral]] on a mercenary mission on [[Episode 6]]
