Market in the lower city on [[The Rock of Bral]]

DM says that when we arrive into the bazaar there is a shop with a suit of armor, a shop with a grindstone and sword, and a shop with a pistol.

Astrid wanted to go into the weapon shop and looks for a new handle for the dagger "you'll look good in pink". the weapon begrudgingly agreed to look for a new handle.

### Armory
- smell the tanning of leather, and hear the pounding of metal on meta
- We see a #Plasmoid. It slinks out of the armor and the armor falls to the ground
- he had some full plate, half plate, both of which could be custom fitted by his liquid nature. It was FAR too expensive to afford anything right now and he didn't even bother showing off the rings after I told him that his armor was too expensive. He said the rings were too magical but out of my range.
- He told us that the #Hadozee [[Griffith]] might be able to work on for us.

### Weapon shop (Mindflayer's Bane)
- run by [[Nad'Azam of Creche Zelek]] (I didn't meet this person)
- [[Astrid]] tried to change the hilt on her dagger, but it changed for her by her mood

### Gunsmith
- Run by [[Griffith]]
- [[Bex Berghold]] started to clean off the pistol and revealed sigils and many notches. It's former owner was an infamous [[Pirate John Raskin]]

## Giths a plenty
- run by [[Krell'Azam]]
- A magic shop that we got some potions and the cloak of the protection. [[Astrid]] rizzed the shopkeep and got a sweet deal.
- last we were there he had a cloak of featherfalling that he claimed could also help navigate wildspace.
