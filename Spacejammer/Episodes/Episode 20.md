to fulfill our promise to [[Vortshu]] we went back to his moon and started our fight with the [[Bulette]]!
This will secure the [[Aartuk]] and the [[Ssurran]] to help us fight against the astral elves. We left off with one [[Bulette]] already dead and the other had survived one round from our party.

we killed the second [[Bulette]] and I skinned it for some of it's shell. I showed it [[Bex Berghold]] and she wasn't sure if she could shape it. [[Mister Flinch]] showed up and said he could make 2 sets of half-plate armor for [[Bex Berghold]] and [[Morgana Noldra]]!

I spoke to a [[Hadoozee]] and he told me a bit more about my pistol from [[Pirate John Raskin]]. I found out it's not a +2 and provides me proficiency in any charisma based check where I'm not already proficient. We bought some healing potions and some potions of radiant resistance. We departed into the astral sea, and were met by a red dragon being ridden by an ironclad knight.

Turns out this was a [[Githyanki]] who made a joke that we were trespassing and she was here to decapitate our captain, but turns out she's hunting mindflayers. she handed me an oil of sharpness and was swiftly on her way.
