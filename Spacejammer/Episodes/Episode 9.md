Still on [[The Rock of Bral]]. We took the sword from [[Nad'Azam of Creche Zelek]] and returned it to [[Krell'Azam]] in exchange for the orrery. I wanted to give it to [[Large Luigi]] to hold onto, but then we ran into [[Commodore Krux]]! He heard about some of our adventures and invited us aboard his ship to discuss further and suggested we take the orrery along with us. On the way to his ship, we ran into a group of [[The Xaryxians|Xaryxian Soldiers]] that said we had humiliated their captain when we fought them on [[The Moondancer]] way back when. IT'S HEATING UP! We fought off the elves and a crowd started to gather. We saw more Xaryxians gathering and took [[Commodore Krux]] to his ship. Turns out he had a living ship! There was a Tiefling [[Fel Ardra]] who was renting the ship, a Hadozee, and a Treant connected to the ship (living ship). The ship was called [[Second Wind]]
