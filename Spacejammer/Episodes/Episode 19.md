got a massive headache :/

switching to every other week after this one.

After we defeated [[Gorma]] the [[Megapede]] at the arena in [[Vocath]], the arena top collapses and [[Xelith]] enters riding a [[Solar Dragon]]!!!! We are all low hp and he is demanind [[Xedalli]] be returned to the thrown. Definitely makes me think I was right to distrust the #Xaryxian

[[Xedalli]] suddenly appears next to us and agrees to go with [[Xelith]] to support his claim to the throne. She then hands [[Astrid]] a ring saying she'll need it to save our the [[Planet of Malderon]]. We then hear from [[Vocath]] saying we earned an army. I claim this is pointless now because [[Xedalli]] had claimed that she was the key for their father to ascend to godhood, and now she's gone. [[Astrid]] then hears from [[Xedalli]] that this ring is really the key to their ascension. I'm having trouble believing one lie for another lie.

we then join [[Vocath]] and 5 other regally dressed people.
- a bird race (2 - failed check) [[Aarakocra]] named [[Rika]]
- a [[Hadoozee]] named [[Dakaer]]
- a bug race (10 - memory) [[Thri-Kreen]] named [[T'kitka]]
- a plant race (memory) [[Aartuk]] named [[Vortshu]]
- a lizard race (8 - failed) [[Ssurran]] named [[]]

[[Dakaer]] took a look at my pistol and read of some [[Hadoozee]] runes where I am revealed to be a prophesized son of [[Pirate John Raskin]]! I told him we had to grab a drink so I could hear more.

I am destined to be one of the world's greatest boatsman and have it good with the ladies on my adventures! wowza. My pistol is now glowing a bit of a red hue. I'll have to ask [[Bex Berghold]] what this means or see for myself by testing it out. Their spelljammer wasn't able to identify what it did exactly to my pistol.

the [[Aartuk]] has agreed to forgive our previous murdering if we agreed to kill a [[Bulette]] that terrorizes their planet

[[Bex Berghold]] then speaks with the [[Ssurran]] and tries to persuade him to join our army, but she's not the most charismatic. It turns out the [[Ssurran]] wants revenge and wants to suck the life energy from the [[The Xaryxians|astral elves]]. we agreed that the [[The Xaryxians|astral elves]] are total dicks, but they weren't willing to join unless all of the factions joined, so we had to agree to the [[Aartuk]] and their [[Bulette]] problem


- [[Barristan Tardiff - ME]] travels with [[Dakaer]]
- [[Bex Berghold]] travels with the [[Thri-Kreen]]
- [[Astrid]] travels with [[Aarakocra]] and [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]]
- [[Morgana Noldra]] travels with [[Vocath]]
- [[Topolah]], [[Commodore Krux]], [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]]

We leveled up to level 8!

to fulfill our promise to [[Vortshu]] we went back to his moon and started our fight with the [[Bulette]]!
