all of us were together in grand junction!

We were headed back into doom space from the astral sea and spotted [[Doxylamine]] hitchhiking. [[Bex Berghold]] questions her and we find  out that [[Doxylamine]] is a stowaway, but also a captain who's ship has been destroyed. [[Bex Berghold]] and [[Barristan Tardiff - ME]] went to "investigate" [[Commodore Krux]]'s bedroom as he was passed out. [[Bex Berghold]] took a whiff of some strong alcohol and passed out, while I took a whiff and was fine. I looked around his room, but found nothing better than some poop on the edge of his toilet. 

[[Astrid]] and [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]] flirted on the deck for a while, we were off to doom space. We played a bit of liars dice. [[Barristan Tardiff - ME]] won the first round by calling getting called out by [[Doxylamine]]. [[Doxylamine]] won the second round by getting called out by [[Pox]].

After a few games of liars dice, we stopped playing and hear "ahoy" from a distance and then we feela thud. We see a giant dinosaur hanging. It was a Braxat.

[[Doxylamine]] swiftly vomited onto my shoes and trousers. Who knows what this tiefling is about.

The Braxat jumped off the ship; Doxylamine fell asleep, [[Bex Berghold]] tried to heal [[Starbough]] on [[Second Wind]]. He says it's going to take another day and we should take a rest, but we felt freshly rested from before. [[Commodore Krux]] was mad that [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]]'s ship had sunk. 

We found [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]] and had to fight off a group of 6 star weedlings and a starhorror.
