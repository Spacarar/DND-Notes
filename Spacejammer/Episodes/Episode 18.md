switching to every other week after ~~this one~~ *next one*.

I'm in bad shape at the start of this fight and use second wind to heal myself. I then wiffed both my attacks. The [[megapede]] attacks and misses me thankfully. [[Morgana Noldra|Morgana]] casts blight and deals 32 necrotic damage, then rams the sphere for an additional 10! It's then [[Bex Berghold|Bex]]'s turn. [[Bex Berghold|Bex]] attacks and hits for 6 damage. [[Astrid]]'s up next with a sneak attack (16 hits, maybe that's AC). She does 24 piercing damage. 

The crowd is going wild for [[Gorma]] as he critted me into oblivion dealing 88 damage! fuck

Morgana cannot take actions or reactions because of the megapede incapacitating her! jesus christ

[[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]] saved me with a greater healing potion, but then the megapede instantly knocked [[Bex Berghold|Bex]] down too! this fight is TOUGH!

[[Major Warwyck Blastimoff|Warwyck]] used his last potion to save [[Bex Berghold|Bex]] and then [[Gorma]] runs up and attacks [[Astrid]]. luckily she had evasion to help reduce some of the damage.

After we killed [[Gorma]] suddenly [[Xelith]] shows up riding a [[Solar Dragon]]! oh shit!
