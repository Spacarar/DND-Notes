We continued exploring [[The Crashed Nautiloid]]. Found a bit of loot, A few scimitars and heavy crossbows, and a hair pin from the niogi. stuff looked chewed up on the cargo deck by something, then when we exploring the prison cells, we heard scuffling and a dead mindflayer in a larger cell. [[Morgana Noldra]] found a breastplate on the dead mindflayer in the cell. Astrid stumbled upon rations and food that was used to sustain the prisoners, with a tall creature hunched over. There was something eating some rations, it was a large white animal thing we thought was an owlbear. As soon as we boarded back on [[The Marlin]] the boat was rocked. It was a spider-like looking ship, the captain shouts "Night Spider".  The night spider was counter-attacked by some vessels from [[The Rock of Bral]]. When we arrived at bral, some #Hadozee were grieving and we discovered that [[Gepar]] had gone missing and was believed dead. We are on the hunt to find him.
