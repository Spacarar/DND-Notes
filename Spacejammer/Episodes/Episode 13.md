[[Topolah]] boards starbow and speaks with him. [[Bex Berghold]] listened in as we head "due east along the z axis". We take a full rest and wake up to [[Commodore Krux]] yelling "all hands on deck". Dead ahead we a cloud of several ships. 3 flying fishes 3 lamprays 2 squidrays and 2 xxxmoths. We decided to fly through the rubble. A flag dripping blood red fell on our deck and [[Astrid]] tried to attack it but completely missed. There were some [[Vampirates]] that we threw into the brig. I didn't think this was a good idea, but it is what it is. They said their names are as Pox (f) and Lokrin (m). As we continue to move through the wreckage. A will-o-wisp appeared on the ship and offered to guide us to [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]]. Aboard his ship was actually a [[The Xaryxians|Xaryxian]] princess claimed Xydali. We took over the ship, but weren't sure about manning it.
