Just boarded the [[The Moondancer]], but [[Captain Elaina Sartel]] says she'll drop us off at the rock of [[The Rock of Bral]] in the meantime I'm to man the ballista for any threats. At the docks. Just [[The Xaryxians]] just invaded our ship. We hit them a few times but then 3 of them boarded our ship. We fought them off but they killed the ooze revealed as a chest. "Chestie" fought valiantly, only landing 1 hit before eating it.

We made our way to the [[The Happy Beholder]] and that's where I made friends with [[Large Luigi]]. The others got into a scuffle with a thief after [[Astrid]] drank some drugged ale.
