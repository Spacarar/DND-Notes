We won our battle against [[Hastain]]. The controls seem to be ruined for a while. I recovered from my blindness and we see [[Commodore Krux]] put his hands to the captains quarters, take a puff from his pipe and tell us to settle in. I spot a tower nearby covered in space gulls who are a docile creature who notably nest near towers. Turns out [[Topolah]] was in the tower! He says we'll go out to the tower in some of the rowboats. She gave us a tour. On the first floor there was a bunch of contraptions and a number of [[AutoGnome]]s all introduced as "Orwick". The ones on the first floor were labeled (1, 3, 6, 8). The second floor had two more gnomes labeled (2, 4) in the kitchen cooking. There was also an unmade bed, a wardrobe, and a whole ton of bird nests. On the third floor, 2 more gnomes are there polishing the telescope which allows her to spy on all worlds in this system and gaze on other worlds as well.  (5, 7). [[Bex Berghold]] looked through the telescope to see The [[Planet of Malderon]] has now been fully encased in crystal. Bex asks to view [[The Rock of Bral]] where she is noted to see an extremely large plasmoid commanding people. [[Commodore Krux]] said we're looking for the grave alliance and she was supposed to aide in looking for them. She asks us to slay "Big Mama" who is only known by it's large red eye. 

Right as we boarded back on [[Second Wind]] Big Mama herself showed up and slammed against the ship.

After we defeated Big Mama [[Topolah]] said we could find [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]] as a contact to find [[The Grave Alliance]] and he also owes [[Topolah]] a favor.
