After the last session, we made a break for the citadel as the ships were still duking it out, hoping that we could stop the ritual before it's too late.

We approach the [[Imperial Citadel]]

The left wing tip appears to be military, and the right wing tip appears to be merchant. We decided to land on the merchant side and were quickly told it would've ended in woe had we chosen otherwise. We decided to take [[Mister Flinch]] along so he could help us get through the port of entry. He bribed one of the guards and we made it into the "Low Quarter". We overheard that this was the funeral for [[Emporer Xevon]] and the people might not think that [[Xedalli]] would be a rightful ruler.

We muster our way through the crowd just in time to see [[Emporer Xevon]]'s ascension.  [[Astrid]] pipes up to object to [[Xelith]]'s takeover as ruler in favor of [[Xedalli]]. Because of this, we declare trial by combat and [[Xedalli]] has declared us her champion for the battle. We then see a 7ft tall suit of armor called [[Xodar]] who has fought for the family for generations.

We defeated [[Xodar]], [[Xedalli]] immediately turned on us and told the guards to seize us. [[Xodar]] then lights up, tells us that if we throw the ring of shooting stars into the sun, that it will undo all the destruction they have caused.

We decided that [[Solara Sunfire]] would sacrifice herself to the sun portal to destroy this. We rushed back to the [[Second Wind]]. We took on a few survivors, but only could carry so many people. [[Xeristopher Planeswalkin]] announced. Thank you Foo Fighters for your service. We headed back to [[Planet of Malderon]] and we see that the crystal vines that have engulfed the world have shattered and collapsed. The [[The Xaryxians|Astral Elves]] have some strongholds
