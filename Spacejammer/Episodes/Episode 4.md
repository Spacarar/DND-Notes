Still on [[The Rock of Bral]] We then did some shopping in [[Lesser Market of Bral]], we got my pistol fixed up and it turned out to be previously owned by [[Pirate John Raskin]] and after that we saw an ad for some mercenaries on some salvage work and that's when we boarded [[The Marlin]] a flying fish type vessel captained by [[Pok-Cha]]. He is a #thri-kreen - creatures that look like ants and have 4 arms, which [[Bex Berghold]] became particularly interested in. We ran into a crashed nautiloid ship and there was a man on board. At first he claimed he was alone, but then said his family was on board and he was protecting them. This feels like a trap.
