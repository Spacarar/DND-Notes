We just picked up [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]] somewhere in [[Doom Space]] on the [[Moon of Aruun]]. he was being chased by some star weedlings and a star horror, but those were also being chased by 2 bulettes and we had to fight those off as well.

Starting off strong we got ambushed by 2 bulettes. They were tanky as hell. I broke both my longsword and my handaxe on it. [[Bex Berghold|Bex]] went down and had to be healed by [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff|Warwyck]] with a greater healing potion. One of the bulettes nearly took down the ship by grabbing on the rope and knocked [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale|Gilgamesh]] out of the ship and I fell on top of him. These Bulettes were tough!! [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff|Warwyck]] got attacked and I had to carry him up the ladder. I'm struggling, but we're making our way up.

We ran from the bulettes and made it back onto the ship. We took a long rest and woke up sore. I decided to check in with [[Commodore Krux]] and [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]] in the morning to see what the plan is. He was telling us about a [[Mercane]] named [[Vocath]] will be able to help us.
