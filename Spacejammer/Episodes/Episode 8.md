Still on [[The Rock of Bral]]. we took a long rest, and waited a while for kristen to show up. To start the session, [[Bex Berghold]] went to the [[Lesser Market of Bral]] and showed off her leathery sailcloth to the #Plasmoid armorers. She's wondering if she could fasten some armor. After being told they couldn't work on it, she headed over to Gith's o' Plenty to speak with [[Krell'Azam]]. She purchased a circlet of blasting, and we found a orrery (planetarium table). We were told that it would show all the people and update the stars as we move around the system. We took up a quest to retrieve a sword from [[Nad'Azam of Creche Zelek]] in exchange for the orrery.
