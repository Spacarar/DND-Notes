Picking up with [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]] and his ship. We discussed what to do with Pox and Lochrin. I suggested that we split up the vampirates and take Pox and Lochrin with us and Gargenhale on his ship, which [[Bex Berghold]] and [[Astrid]] seemed on board with. [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]] claims that [[Planet of Malderon]] is only covered in crystals and is not yet destroyed and that's why he has kidnapped [[Xedalli]]. [[Xedalli]] claims to have an evil twin [[Xelith]] who is stealing her birthright and seized control of navy, and orchestrated the attack on malderon. Crystal vines drain energy and discharge to xariasis. [[Xedalli]] was supposed to be a sacrafice on Malderon. He claims that she is leverage and we can unseat the emporer under from under [[Xelith]]. [[Bex Berghold]] has seen a glimpse of something hidden beneath [[Xedalli]]'s story and has suggested using "suggestion" on her to ensure that she'll do what she says.

As I head over back to the old ship, I see [[Commodore Krux]] looking sad and tell me a war story about a fight against [[The Xaryxians]] where he ran after running from the solar dragon mounts. He hates [[The Xaryxians]] only as much as his own cowardice. I failed to persuade him and he didn't even listen to me about [[Xedalli]]'s plan! [[Bex Berghold]] and [[Astrid]] wanted to stay with [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]]. [[Topolah]] may have broken up with him and she went back to [[Second Wind]] with [[Commodore Krux]] and [[Barristan Tardiff - ME]]. 

Backflow tester showed up and I had to step out, but girls were talking with gargenhale on his ship for the duration. [[Topolah]] notably went home. I came back to the girls playing a dice game. seemed like pirates dice, but I forgot how to play. We played 2 games and I lost both which felt stupid.

I tried to fish and failed (6). [[Bex Berghold]] went to speak with [[Xedalli]], where she spoke of her father and brother [[Xelith]]. [[Bex Berghold]] questioned [[Xedalli]] why she was supposed to inherit the throne over her brother. She said that apparently siblings sharing the throne is common in their culture, but her brother usurped the throne. They further discussed our travel to go to an imperial fortress, but she said we'd definitely need more people to take on the entire empire. We might have to rethink our strategy because sneaking in probably won't work out well.
