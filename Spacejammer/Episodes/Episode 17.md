Olivia joined up.

Floating above the crystal moon of [[Vocath]]. A scorpion, a wasp, a dragonfly ship are parked outside. He has a statue of himself out front.

It turns out that [[Vocath]] runs an arena and is obsessed with betting. [[Morgana Noldra]] introduced herself to him; stumbling over her words, she says that [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]] scares her. We docked and we all got off the ship to confront the [[Mercane]]. As we stepped foot onto the base, we hear a loud roar. This is an arena, the crowd cheering, the clanging of swords, the rumble and roar. I was curious to see what was going on, so I headed towards the arena. [[Grimzod (Gargamel) Gargenhale]] started looking for a new ship because his last one was blown to smithereens.

We make it up to the stairs and see forcefields blocking both directions as well as 2 Giff and Githyanki. The Githyanki were guarding a Mercane. [[Bex Berghold]] traded her trident for a +1 greatsword for me! wow. [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]] pleaded with [[Vocath]] to help us and meet with the faction leaders of [[Doom Space]] with "just 1 catch"

You must survive 3 battles in my arena with no resting between them. 

WE enter the arena to find 2, 4-armed giants Gnasher and Thrasher. They look absolutely massive. We quickly dispatched Gnasher when [[Astrid]] shot an arrow straight through his skull. we won

Then entered a Braxat, a brown scavver and a gray scavver. [[Major Warwyck Blastimoff]] got swallowed whole by the brown scavver. 

The final boss of the arena was a a [[Megapede]]
