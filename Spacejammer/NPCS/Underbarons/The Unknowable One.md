A member of [[The Underbarons]] on [[The Rock of Bral]]. Said to be a smuggler. Not much is known about them *cough cough* the name says it all. We don't know how to meet them or where to find them, but we may be able to ask around.

We ran into him after "besting" his puzzles, and he said [[Gepar]] was already given away, but he could help us go looking for him. The guards asked him to get rid of [[Gepar]] because they couldn't do themselves. The guards did want him alive, he was delivered to the undercity to put him to work where he would never be seen again, or never see the light of day.

he hands us a mindflayer tadpole. he says we can speak the phrase to activate the sending stone "N'Gl'Toth (ing-ill-toth)" and then speak your message. he says he will respond quickly.
