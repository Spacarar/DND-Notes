Man who flagged us down on [[The Crashed Nautiloid]] at first he said he was alone, then we said his family was on board. I don't trust him. He claims the ship was attacked by the gniogi (spelling)? and now they are in dire need of saving. They said they comandeered a mindflayer ship before he was striken. I asked to help him board the ship and said he was injured. I wanted to help him onto the marlin but I rolled a nat 20, and threw him into the astral sea where he began to transform.

[[Astrid]] and [[Bex Berghold]] were the first to see him transform where [[Bex Berghold]] found out that he was a #Psurlon - who are known to have a  symbiotic relationship with mindflayers where the mindflayer will eat the mind and the psurlon will eat the body.
