old friend of [[Commodore Krux]] living out in [[Doom space]]

We met her in [[Episode 12]]. Loves birds, had a wonderful garden full of mechanical contraptions, [[AutoGnome]] (all introduced with Orwick labeled 1, 3, 6, and 8), bird eggs, and all kinds of things. On the second floor 2 more gnomes were here (2, 4) in the kitchen. There was also an unmade bed, a wardrobe and bird nests. It seems like these Orwick's were too busy to pay us any mind on this floor.
