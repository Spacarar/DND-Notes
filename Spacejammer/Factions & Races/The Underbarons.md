Ring leaders of the darker side on [[The Rock of Bral]]. They are big players on some of the shadier things known to happen

- [[Ozamata Ku Murawa]] (human) "owns the undercity" you can see his men usually by the docks, helping smuggle out different.
- [[Meredin Sandyfoot]] (halfing) in the burrows, who has a lot of sway over the craftspeople on the rock
- [[The juggler]] (elf) who oversees the swindlers in town. runs a guild house in the city "the jugglers folk guild house".
- "[[The Unknowable One]]" also a smuggler, but not much is known about him. he smuggles stuff. We might be able to talk to him to infiltrate the interior. we don't know how to meet them or where to find them, but we might be able to deduce a little bit.
